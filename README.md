# Machine-Learning-KNN-SVM-Comparison
This is a project testing the differences in 2 different models on the same data set: K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine.
The data set contains 1000 observations with 35 features each. This is an automatically generated data set with no real world values; it was created for
assessment purposes. All the variables are continuous with no values missing.
